# BellmanFord

## Distributed Bellman-Ford algorithm implementation for the Networking I course

This implementation assumes the nodes are 'blind' and can only move to nodes they're directly linked to.

If one or more nodes are unreachable, that means they are not linked to the same graph.

To run the project, move to the src folder and run:

<pre><code>python main.py <'filename.txt'>
</code></pre>

A copy of the final output is written on the output.txt file inside the project.
